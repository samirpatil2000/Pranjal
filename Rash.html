            <strong>Are Rashes a Sign of COVID-19?</strong><br>
            <br> COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. While many people who become sick with COVID-19 experience a mild or moderate illness, some can develop serious symptoms that require hospitalization.According to data from the
            Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),there have been over 33 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States. Since COVID-19 vaccines have been rolled out, the rate of new cases is trending downward. The most common symptoms
            of COVID-19 are fatigue, fever, and cough. However, some people may experience less common symptoms.One of these is rash. Below, we explore what COVID-19 rashes look like, how they can be treated, and when it’s important to see a doctor.
            <br>
            <strong>rashes a sign of COVID-19?</strong><br>
            <br> Some individuals with COVID-19 may develop a rash. While skin symptoms have been reported in adults and children, most available research centers on adults.A 2020 meta-analysis of 2,261 people with COVID-19 estimated that the prevalence
            of skin symptoms was about 1 percent. However, according to a 2021 review, the exact incidence of rash in COVID-19 remains unknown.<br>
            <br>
            <ul><strong>Some general symptoms associated with many COVID-19 rashes include:</strong></ul><br>
            <li>Skin discoloration: Rashes are typically discolored in comparison to neighboring skin.</li>
            <li> On light skin, a rash may look red, pink, or purple.</li>
            <li> On dark skin, it may appear purple, ashy grey, or dark brown</li>
            <li>Swelling: The affected area may appear swollen or puffy compared to surrounding skin.</li>
            <li>Itching: Many, but not all, types of COVID-19 rash may itch.</li><br>
            <br>
            <strong>do rashes appear and how long do they last?</strong> <br> When exactly the rash occurs during COVID-19 can vary. In some instances, it may appear at COVID-19 symptom onset, while in others, it may happen several days after other symptoms
            have developed.According to information from the American Academy of Dermatology, COVID-19 rash can last 2 to 12 days. On average, most people have a rash for 8 days. However, rashes impacting the toes may last 10 to 14 days.<br>
            <br>
            <strong> What does a COVID-19 rash look like?</strong><br> The exact appearance of COVID-19 rashes can vary by individual. While some infectious diseases, such as chickenpox and measles, cause a very distinctive rash, a rash due to COVID-19
            can take many forms:<br> Hives: COVID-19 rash can appear as itchy patches or wheals that resemble hives. These most often affect the limbs and torso. Macules and papules: In some cases, a COVID-19 rash can consist of itchy spots that may either
            be flat or raised. This type of rash often impacts the torso.<br> Rash with blisters: This type of COVID-19 rash can appear with blisters that may look similar to chickenpox. It’s most often been observed on the torso and may itch.<br> Lace-like
            pattern:Some COVID-19 rashes can have rings of skin discoloration that form a lace or net-like pattern. This kind of COVID-19 rash typically affects the legs.<br> Pinpoint spots: This type of COVID-19 rash consists of dark pinpoint spots.
            The legs are the most commonly impacted area.<br> Toe rash: Also referred to as “COVID toes,” this type of rash causes discolored patches and swelling of one or more toes. The affected area may be painful, itchy, or have a burning sensation.
            Toe rashes appear to be more commonTrusted Source in young adults.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Can you get a rash after you’ve been vaccinated?</strong><br>
            <br> It’s also possible to get a rash after receiving your COVID-19 vaccine. Let’s look at this in a little more detail.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Allergic reaction</strong><br>
            <br> Some people may have an allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine. If this happens, you may notice a rash or hives after you get your vaccine. Allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine can be classified as either non-severe or severe:<br>            Non-severe: Non-severe allergic reactions happen within 4 hours of vaccination. They may include signs such as hives, swelling, and wheezing.<br> Severe: This type of reaction is called anaphylaxis.It typically happens in the minutes after
            vaccination and can include hives,swelling of the face and throat,and dizziness or fainting.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>What’s the best way to treat a rash from COVID-19?</strong><br>
            <br> If you develop an unexplained rash, it’s a good rule of thumb to talk with a doctor. COVID-19 rashes may appear very similar to rashes caused by other medical conditions that need treatment. The only way to be sure if your rash is due
            to COVID-19 is to get a COVID-19 test.<br>
            <br>
