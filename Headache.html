            reported in 13.6 percentTrusted Source of these cases. A CDC report on people hospitalized with COVID-19 found that a headache was reported 9.6 to 21.3 percentTrusted Source of the time, depending on the age of the individual. A headache was
            found to be a more common symptom in people under the age of 65.<br>
