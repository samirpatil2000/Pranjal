            Coughing and fever accompanied by shortness of breath is another confirmed sign of coronavirus infection. Persistent dry cough puts a lot of pressure on your respiratory tract, but that should not leave you gasping for air. If it does that then that means
            it is not a seasonal issue and you may be infected with the virus. Up to 40 per cent of coronavirus patients reported that they felt breathless during the initial days. Shortness of breath is also a sign of long COVID. Most people experience
            it even weeks after recovering from the infection.
            <br>

            <ul><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></ul>
            <li>Shortness of breath is a common symptom of coronavirus when paired with fever and cough.</li>
            <li>Breathlessness is even more common amongst hospitalized patients.</li>
            <li>In symptomatic people, shortness of breath does not usually present itself until between day 5 and 8.</li>

            <br> Lots of different medical conditions can cause sudden shortness of breath: asthma, a chest infection, heart disease, anxiety, panic attacks, and yes — COVID-19. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The virus
            affects cells in the airways, from the nose and throat down to the deepest parts of the lungs. When it’s in the nose and throat, it usually causes symptoms of a cold and cough. When the coronavirus lodges itself deep in the lungs, it can cause
            a lung infection, or pneumonia. <br>

            <br>
            <strong>What is shortness of breath?</strong> <br> Shortness of breath is the feeling that you are out of breath, like you can’t catch your breath or that it’s hard work to inhale fully. Sometimes, it can feel like tightness around the chest.
            Another medical term for these symptoms is “dyspnea.” Feeling short of breath can be normal. It can happen, for example, if you’re exercising, you’re at a high altitude, or you’re anxious. But if the shortness of breath doesn’t go away when
            you rest, or you feel short of breath after little or no activity, that’s a sign that something is not right. Shortness of breath can come on suddenly in otherwise healthy people. It can also be a part of daily life for many people with a
            chronic lung or heart condition. <br>

            <br>
            <strong>Is shortness of breath an early sign of COVID?</strong> <br> Shortness of breath is usually not an early symptom of COVID-19. Data suggests that feeling breathless usually comes on over the course of a week after other symptoms start.
            So imagine having a coronavirus infection with no symptoms for 5 days before developing mild symptoms of fever, tiredness, loss of taste and/or smell, and body aches. It may be 10 days before you start to feel breathless — and it could be
            even longer. Some statistics: According to clinical studies, shortness of breath develops on average between day 5 and day 8 of symptoms. Note that these are average (median) numbers. Life-threatening shortness of breath can happen at any
            point during the course of COVID-19 and should always be taken as a sign that you need to seek urgent medical attention.<br>

            <br>
            <strong>Shortness of breath and COVID: How common of a symptom is it?</strong><br> One of the symptoms of COVID-19 is shortness of breath. In fact, the combination of shortness of breath with fever and a dry cough is seen as being highly suggestive
            of a COVID-19 infection.<br>

            <br>
            <strong>How common is shortness of breath in all people with COVID-19?</strong> <br> Well, one study found that 39% of inpatients and outpatients reported experiencing shortness of breath on the day of testing for COVID. Shortness of breath
            is still less common than fever and cough, but overall is the most prevalent symptom in people hospitalized due to COVID-19. Don't miss out on savings! Get the best ways to save on your prescriptions delivered to your inbox. Enter your email

            of breath than those with more severe disease. Why? Shortness of breath is caused by an infection in the lungs known as pneumonia. Not everyone with COVID-19 gets pneumonia, though. If you don’t have pneumonia, you probably won’t feel short
            of breath. Some statistics: Based on results from clinical studies, it’s estimated that between 1.4% and 7.6% of people who had a mild coronavirus infection felt shortness of breath. Feeling breathless with COVID-19 usually means the lungs
            are infected. If the coronavirus has caused pneumonia, then — depending on how serious it is — the lungs may struggle to get enough oxygen into the bloodstream. This is a problem because oxygen is an essential nutrient for every organ in the
            body. Not having enough oxygen in the blood makes us feel out of breath. It also makes the body breathe harder and faster to try to get more oxygen, which also makes us feel breathless. Having shortness of breath can predict a more severe
            illness. Those who are unlucky enough to get pneumonia from COVID-19 are more likely to feel breathless than those who do not get it. They are also more likely to experience severe illness, often needing hospitalization and oxygen to help
            them breathe. Sometimes, they even need to be placed into an artificial coma and have a machine breathe for them in an effort to try and buy time until the lungs heal. This is called artificial ventilation and can only be done in an intensive
            care unit or a similar environment. Some statistics: In a review of 30 studies looking at patients with COVID-19, about 45% of those with severe infections were breathless when they were hospitalized.
