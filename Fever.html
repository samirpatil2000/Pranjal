            <strong>What Is the Temperature Range for COVID-19?</strong><br>
            <br> COVID-19 symptoms, including fever, can start anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks after exposure to the virus. Fever is one of the ways your body tries to fight off infection. For that reason, it’s a common symptom of COVID-19, which typically
            gets reported by those who have it.However, not everyone who gets COVID-19 will develop a fever. According to the CDCTrusted Source, you have a fever if your temperature is 100.4°F (38°C) or greater, no matter what the cause.Read on to find
            out about fever as a symptom of COVID-19 and other symptoms that require medical care.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Temperature range</strong><br>
            <br> In addition to being new, COVID-19 has often been unpredictable. As common a symptom as fever is, there is no definitive temperature range for this condition. Some people who test positive never run a fever. Others spike very high fevers.A
            large review of multiple studiesTrusted Source across nine countries observed 24,420 adults with COVID-19, and 78 percent ran a fever at some point during their illness. A later review of studiesTrusted Source involving 17,515 adults and children
            with COVID-19 uncovered similar results. Of all the adult participants, 79.43 percent ran a fever during their illness. Low- and medium-grade fevers were also more likely to occur in this population than high fevers. Researchers also noted
            that fever was less likely to occur in children, especially during the early days when symptoms begin. They found that 45.86 percent of 373 children in China experienced fever. The authors conclude that over 50 percent of children under 18
            years old with COVID-19 presented without fever.<br>

            <strong>Other things to know about fever and COVID-19</strong><br>
            <br> Despite the lack of a specific temperature range, it is clear that fever can indicate serious illness. The majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have fever as a symptom. However, running a high fever does not mean you will have a
            serious outcome.A studyTrusted Source involving over 7,000 COVID-19 patients in the New York City area found that initial high fever upon hospital admission did not correlate significantly with death.However, persistent high fevers throughout
            the course of illness were significantly correlated with death due to COVID-19. People whose fevers spiked to 104°F (40°C) or higher had a mortality rate of 42 percent.This same study found that abnormally low body temperatures were associated
            with the poorest outcomes. Those with a body temperature under 96.8°F (36°C) had the highest death rates.These findings may indicate that problems with body temperature regulation are a marker of serious COVID-19 cases.
