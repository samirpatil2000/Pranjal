            <br> COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.

            <ul><strong>symptoms:</strong></ul>
            <li>fever</li>
            <li>dry</li>
            <li>cough</li>
            <li>tiredness</li>

            Both common cold and COVID-19 cold develop after coming in contact with a virus that affects the upper respiratory tract. The pathogens spread from one person to another through tiny respiratory droplets that come from the nose and mouth of the infected
            person while speaking, coughing or talking. However, it is important to remember that both types of virus are different and lead to different symptoms. A person can develop COVID-19 after contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is a type of
            coronavirus.

            <ul><strong>compared to common cold, COVID-19 cold:</strong></ul>
            <li>causes more diverse symptoms</li>
            <li>has a longer incubation period</li>
            <li>has a higher risk of severity and fatality</li> <br> Dry cough is a telltale symptom of coronavirus that has been witnessed in most patients. Reports suggest that about 59 to 82 per cent of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 experienced dry
            cough during the initial days.Another report published in February 2020 by a joint study by World Health Organization-China found that about 68 per cent of people with COVID-19 developed a dry cough, which was the second most common symptom
            in more than 55,000 confirmed cases. Dry cough simply means youâ€™re coughing but nothing is coming up, like phlegm or mucus.Producing phlegm is a sign of a wet cough and is generally associated with a simple cold and flu. However, a dry cough
            can also be a sign of an allergy. So, it is best to consult your doctor or take the COVID test for confirmation.
