            <br> COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, also known as the new coronavirus. COVID-19 can have a wide variety of symptoms, including a sore throat.But a sore throat is only one of the symptoms that may develop due to COVID-19.
            Some other symptoms are much more common. In this article we’ll explore a sore throat as a symptom of COVID-19, other symptoms to watch out for, and when to seek medical care.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Is a sore throat a common symptom of COVID-19?</strong><br>
            <br> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the symptoms that develop with COVID-19 can varyTrusted Source from one person to another.A sore throat can be one symptom of COVID-19. At this point in time, it isn’t
            well documented when exactly a sore throat occurs in the course of the infection.In other respiratory illnesses, like the common cold, a sore throat is often an early symptom. Because respiratory viruses are inhaled, they enter your nose and
            throat first. They may replicate there early on, leading to throat soreness and irritation. Overall, a sore throat isn’t a very common COVID-19 symptom. A study in China, commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO), found that out
            of more than 55,000 confirmed cases, only 13.9 percentTrusted Source of people reported a sore throat.Two smaller studies in China have also found that a sore throat is a less common COVID-19 symptom. One study reported it in only 5 percentTrusted
            Source of cases, while the other reported a sore throat in 7.1 percentTrusted Source of cases.<br>
            <br>
            <strong> Is Sore Throat a Side Effect from Wearing a Mask?</strong><br>
            <br> To put it simply: Yes, wearing a face mask can cause symptoms of a sore throat. Whether you will get a sore throat from wearing your mask depends on several factors, most of which you have control over.When you wear a mask, it changes
            the moisture level of the air that you are breathing in. The air that you breathe in from beneath the mask may have increased water vapor from your own breath, as well as irritants and pathogens from the mask itself if it has not been cleaned
            properly. If you’re breathing like this for several hours at a time, your throat may start to feel dry and scratchy. A 2020 studyTrusted Source of 250 healthcare workers in a COVID-19 healthcare facility showed that dry noses and sore throats
            were among the common side effects of wearing masks for hours per day.We can emphasize the importance of wearing masks while still acknowledging that wearing a face mask can have side effects. Dry skin and “maskne” are among some of the more
            common side effects you might notice from wearing a face mask.Despite possible side effects, wearing a mask can still be an important way to help reduce the transmission of viruses, such as those that cause the common cold or SARS-CoV-2, which
            is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Read on to learn more about ways to reduce risk for side effects and when to see a doctor about your symptoms.<br>
            <br>
            <strong> Mask hygiene</strong><br>
            <br> Sore throat can be caused by irritants, and irritants can linger and live on masks that have not been cleaned properly. That’s why if your mask is clean, it’s less likely to cause a sore throat.While it might be a bit inconvenient if
            you’re used to popping on the mask you keep in your car’s glove compartment every time you run to the store and then putting it back in there when you’re done, this can lead to a buildup of irritants.There are currently no firm guidelines
            on how many hours you can wear each type of mask. If you have a disposable or surgical mask, dispose of it after each use. Do not try to use it again. If you’re using an N95 mask, you should dispose of that, too, unless you have the equipment
            necessary to steam clean it.Fabric masks should be washed Trusted Source in hot, soapy water and hung up to dry after each daily use. You can also use your washer or dryer if you have one at home. Keep your masks in a clean, dry place (such
            as a disposable paper bag) when you are not wearing them.
