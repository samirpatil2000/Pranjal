            <strong>Is Muscle Pain a Symptom of COVID-19?</strong><br>
            <br> Muscle pain (myalgia) can be a symptom of many different conditions. One of these is COVID-19, the illness that’s caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<br>
            <br>
            <strong> How do you know if you’re experiencing muscle pain due to COVID-19 or another condition?</strong><br> Keep reading below to learn how to tell if muscle pain is due to COVID-19, what other conditions that can lead to muscle pain, and
            when to see a doctor.<br>
            <br>

            <strong>To be clear, many of those symptoms aren't brand-new discoveries:</strong><br>
            <br> In March, ear, nose, and throat specialists in the United Kingdom warned that lost sense of smell and taste may be a symptom of COVID-19; and anecdotally, people have also reported chills, headache, and sore throat. The newly-added symptom
            of muscle pain, however, may be a little more surprising than the rest. While body aches and pain can be the result of pretty much anything, it turns out coronavirus-related muscle pain is a bit different.<br>
            <br>
            <strong> How common is muscle pain with COVID-19?</strong><br>
            <br> The CDC doesn't provide that information on its list of symptoms, but according to the World Health Organization, muscle pain (aka, myalgia) was a little less common than other well-known coronavirus symptoms. A February WHO report, which
            analyzed 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, found that 14.8% of patients reported myalgia or arthralgia (joint pain). That's significantly less than the amount of patients who reported a fever (87.9%) and dry cough (67.7%),
            and still less common than other symptoms like fatigue (38.1%) and shortness of breath (18.6%). It is, however, slightly more common than sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%), and chills (11.4%).<br>
            <br>

            <strong> How to tell if it’s COVID-19?</strong><br>
            <br> Muscle pain due to COVID-19 is believed to result from the effects of inflammatory molecules released by immune cells in response to the virus.It’s also possible, but not yet confirmed, that the virus may directly infect muscle tissue.<br>            There are some ways that you may be able to decide whether your symptoms are due to COVID-19 or something else. We’ll explore some of these in more detail below.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>STOP! Take a COVID-19 test first</strong><br> First, take a COVID-19 test. This is the only way to be sure if your muscle pain is due to COVID-19.Talk a your doctor or visit your state’s Department of Health websiteTrusted Source to
            find out about testing sites near you.<br>

            <strong>Onset</strong><br> Another way to determine if your muscle pain is due to COVID-19 is to evaluate when and how it started.Symptoms of COVID-19 typically come on gradually, about 2 to 14 daysTrusted Source after exposure to the novel
            coronavirus. When muscle pain starts during a COVID-19 infection can vary by person. A 2020 studyTrusted Source based on clinical data predicted that muscle pain may happen after fever and cough, but around the same time as a headache or a
            sore throat.Other causes of muscle pain may have a different pattern of onset. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Let’s look at a few specific examples to illustrate this:</strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>Flu:</strong> Flu causes many of the same symptoms as COVID-19. But unlike COVID-19, flu symptoms often come on suddenly as opposed to gradually.<br>

            <strong>Muscle overuse or injury:</strong> This may be the cause if your muscle pain came on following exercise or an activity that requires repetitive motions.<br>

            <strong>Medications:</strong> Some medications, such as statins, can cause muscle pain as a side effect. This may be the cause if your symptoms coincide with the time you take a medication.<br>

            <strong>  Inflammatory myopathies:</strong> Inflammatory myopathies are a rare potential cause of muscle pain. Symptoms often come on gradually, but continue to get worse as time passes.<br>
            <br>
            <strong> Muscle pain after COVID-19 vaccination:</strong><br> Muscle pain is a common side effect that you may experience after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. This is completely normal and is a sign that your body is working to build immunity.
            Side effects from vaccination should go away after a few days. If you received a vaccine that requires two doses (Pfizer or Moderna), side effects may be more intense after you get the second dose.<br>
            <br>

            <strong>Duration</strong><br> The exact length of time that COVID-19 lasts can depend on a person’s overall health as well as the severity of their illness.One studyTrusted Source looked at the duration of symptoms in 270 people with COVID-19.
            While responses ranged between 5 and 12 days, 65 percentTrusted Source of them reported a return to their usual state of health in about 7 days. If your symptoms last a week or so before going away, they may be due to COVID-19. Some symptoms,
            such as cough and loss of smell and taste, may take longer to resolve. Loss of smell and taste have sometimes been reported to linger for months. It’s also important to note here that muscle pain is a potential symptom of long-haul COVID.
            These are symptoms that can last weeks or months after contracting COVID-19. Long-haul COVID symptoms may persist after you’ve recovered from a shorter, acute episode of COVID-19 or appear in the weeks after illness. It’s currently unknown
            what exactly causes long-haul COVID. Researchers are investigating to uncover these causes.<br>

            <strong>What are some other causes of muscle pain?</strong><br> In addition to underlying health conditions, there are also other causes of muscle pain. These are most often related to lifestyle factors, including:<br>

            <strong>Injuries:</strong> It’s possible to injure a muscle by straining or bruising. This can happen through things like falls, twists, or sudden blows.<br>
            <strong>Overuse:</strong> Overuse of a certain muscle group can also cause muscle pain. This often happens when you frequently do an activity that requires repetitive motions.<br>
            <strong>Exercise:</strong> You may experience temporary muscle pain after starting a new exercise regimen or changing your normal exercise routine. This pain typically eases as your muscles adjust to the new routine.<br>
            <strong>Posture:</strong> Having poor posture can place strain on certain muscles, leading to discomfort or pain. Some examples include hunching forward, slouching back in a chair, or leaning onto one leg.<br>
            <strong>Medications:</strong> Certain types of medications can cause muscle pain as a side effect. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>
    When should I see a doctor?</strong><br> Whether muscle pain is due to COVID-19 or not, see a doctor if you’re having muscle pain that: is severe doesn’t go away after several days of at-home care begins to get worse even with treatment<br>
            <br>

            <strong>Muscle pain due to other causes:</strong><br> Here are some ways you can prevent muscle pain from other causes:<br>

            <strong>Warm up and cool down:</strong> Warming up and cooling down properly when you exercise can help reduce the risk of a muscle injury.<br>
            <strong>Ease into new exercise routines:</strong> Slowly easing into a new exercise routine can help your muscles adapt to new activities and movements, lowering your risk of muscle pain.<br>
            <strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Keeping hydrated, particularly during heavy exercise, can help prevent muscle pain.<br>
            <strong>Use good posture:</strong> Poor posture can lead to muscle pain, so aim to improve your posture. Using ergonomic products can help.<br>
            <strong>Take medications as directed:</strong> If you take medications for a health condition that can cause muscle pain, be sure to take these as directed to help prevent pain from occurring.<br>
            <strong>See a doctor regularly:</strong> Many underlying health conditions can cause muscle pain. Seeing a doctor for regular checkups can help detect and treat these conditions early.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>The takeaway</strong><br> Muscle pain is a possible symptom of COVID-19, but can also happen due to many other causes. Pay close attention to your other symptoms as well as their onset and duration to determine if your muscle pain
            is due to COVID-19. But remember that the only way to be sure is to get a COVID-19 test. Often, muscle pain can be treated with OTC pain medications. In some cases, other treatments may be necessary. See a doctor if you have muscle pain that’s
            severe, persistent, or continues to get worse.
