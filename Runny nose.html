            <strong>Is a runny nose a symptom of COVID-19?</strong><br>
            <br> A runny nose can be a symptom of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) note that a runny nose can be a symptom of COVID-19 in both childrenTrusted Source and adultsTrusted Source.There are multiple variantsTrusted
            Source of SARS-CoV-2. According to the Washington State Department of Health, a runny nose is rarely a symptom of COVID-19 that is due to previous variants of the virus, but it can occur.However, according to recent evidence, a runny nose
            may be a main symptom of COVID-19 that results from the recently discovered delta variant.The delta variant accounted for 10% of COVID-19 cases in the United States as of June 14, 2021.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Should a person get a test if they have a runny nose?</strong><br>
            <br> Recent data from the United Kingdom Zoe COVID Symptom study suggest that delta variant infections manifest with a headache, followed by a sore throat, a runny nose, and a fever. For this reason, anyone with a runny nose should consider
            getting a COVID-19 test.For people living in the U.K., tests are not yet available for those with just a runny nose. However, individuals can take a lateral flow test at home.<br> Additionally, if a person is concerned about or unsure of the
            cause of their runny nose, they could contact a doctor or book a COVID-19 test.However, it is also important to remember that allergies such as hay fever are common during the summer months. If a person usually experiences hay fever, their
            runny nose may be due to that rather than COVID-19. The CDC has an advice pageTrusted Source on how a person can get a COVID-19 test. It recommends that a person contacts a healthcare professional or visits their health departmentâ€™s website
            to get information on local testing.If a healthcare professional is unable to perform the test, a person may receive an at-home test kit.<br>
            <br>
            <strong> What else could it be?</strong>
            <br> A runny nose can occur for many reasons. For example, a person may have a runny nose after breathing cold air or after eating spicy food.<br> Having a runny nose by itself is generally not a cause for concern. However, a person with a
            runny nose may want to book a COVID-19 test if they:<br>
            <li>live in an area with high COVID-19 cases </li>
            <li>have recently traveled </li>
            <li>have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19</li>
            <li>are concerned that they have contracted the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2</li><br>
            <br>
            <strong>A runny nose can also occur due to certain other conditions, such as the following.</strong><br>
            <br> The common cold:<br> The common cold can cause symptoms that are similar to those of COVID-19. SymptomsTrusted Source of a cold include:
            <li>a runny nose</li>
            <li>sneezing</li>
            <li>a sore throat</li><br> It can be difficult to tell the difference between cold symptoms and COVID-19 symptoms. However, COVID-19 is more likely than a cold to produce a fever, shortness of breath, and body aches.<br>
            <br>
            <strong> When to contact a doctor?</strong><br>
            <br> If a person is concerned about their runny nose, they should contact a doctor. A doctor can give advice on whether a person needs a COVID-19 test or not.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Summary:</strong>
            <br> A runny nose can be a symptom of COVID-19. According to recent evidence, a person with a runny nose, a headache, a fever, and a sore throat should get a test for COVID-19, as this combination of symptoms may be due to a delta variant
            infection.Many things can cause a runny nose. If a person is concerned about the cause of their runny nose, or if they are experiencing other symptoms of COVID-19, they should contact a doctor.To prevent the transmission of the virus that
            causes COVID-19, it is important to take appropriate measures. Physically distancing from others, wearing masks in public, and washing the hands frequently can all help prevent the transmission of SARS-COV-2.If a person experiences any serious
            symptoms of COVID-19, they should seek medical attention immediately.
